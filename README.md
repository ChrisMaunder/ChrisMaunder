My Repositories are broken up into roughly 4 parts: 
 - CodeProject.AI Server: An MLOps system to allow developers to easily wrap their AI programs, notebooks and experiments into deplpoyable modules for the world to use
 - General MFC components: From days past when MFC was still the cool kid in town
 - Copies of articles I've written over the years on a wide range of disconnected topics
 - Physiology, wearables, health data analysis and anything related to the capture and interpretation of physiological data to help cyclists and athletes train
